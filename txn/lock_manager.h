  //      request for an EXCLUSIVE lock, or
  //
  //  (b) a SHARED lock is held by all elements of the longest prefix of the

  //    (&Txn1, SHARED), (&Txn2, SHARED), (&Txn3, EXCLUSIVE), (&Txn4, SHARED)
  //
  // then Txn1 and Txn2 currently hold a SHARED lock on the record with key
  // "key1". Only when they BOTH release their locks will Txn3 acquire its
  // exclusive lock on the record. (Note that since Txn4 comes after Txn3, it
  // cannot acquire a lock until after Txn3 has released its lock, so it cannot
  // share the lock with Txn1 and Txn2.)

  //
  //    (&Txn1, EXCLUSIVE), (&Txn2, SHARED), (&Txn3, SHARED), (Txn4, EXCLUSIVE)

  // then Txn1 currently holds an EXCLUSIVE lock on "key1". When Txn1 releases
  // its lock, Txn2 and Txn3 will simultaneously acquire SHARED locks on "key1".
